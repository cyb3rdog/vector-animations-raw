# Vector Free Animations project

## Goal

1) First goal of this project is to convert and fix all rigged models and base models for their use in Unity, Blender and other 3d software.
2) Animations files should be extracted as .anim files to be used with the base rigged model asset, similarily as in the Maya the animations referrences the rig model asset.
3) The animation and integration tools for Vector Robot will be incorporated into Unity, where the SDK will be fully integrated with vector asset
4) Other animation software / studios can be build, this is just the beggining of what all will be possible then...

Sincere thanks to [Randall Maas](https://github.com/randym32) for his generous contributions to the OSKR project and to the Vector community!  

Building new animations requires a license to [Autodesk Maya](https://www.autodesk.com/products/maya/overview?term=1-YEAR). Once you have installed Maya, you will need to install the AnkiMenu plugin (see the [AnkiMenu readme](https://github.com/digital-dream-labs/vector-animations-raw/blob/main/assets/tools/plugins/readme.txt)). Once that is done, please see the [documentation](https://github.com/digital-dream-labs/vector-animations-raw/tree/main/documentation) folder for build guidelines.
